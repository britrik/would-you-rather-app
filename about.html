        <p>
            VibingFun is a playful web app designed to help you break the habit of procrastination by making quick, fun decisions. Answer endless “Would You Rather?” questions, challenge your friends, and see how fast you can choose. It’s part brain gym, part party game, and all about celebrating the art of deciding.
